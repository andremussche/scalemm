= Installation =

Just add ScaleMM.pas as the first unit in your Delphi project file (.dpr).
--------------------
program <YourApp>;

uses
  ScaleMM,
  <etc> 
--------------------

ScaleMM can also be used on top of an other memory manager (default it runs
on top of the Delphi memory manager). For example:
--------------------
program <YourApp>;

uses
  FastMM4,
  ScaleMM,
  <etc> 
--------------------

= Limitations =

Currently only memory till 16384 bytes are handled by ScaleMM. Larger blocks 
are handled by the previous memory manager.
Also there is no check for memory leaks. If you run it on top of FastMM (default
MM of Delphi 2007+), you will get memory leaks of ScaleMM itself.
